# Interactive Visualization Mini-projects
This repository contains three mini-projects to depict the use of graphs in data visualizations. They range from simple graphs to more interactive ones to show-case the power of Matplotlib in Python.

1. [Yearly Weather Data Plotting](Weather_Plotting.ipynb)  
This mini-project plots the NOAA dataset on the daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations for the area of Ann arbor, Michigan, United States.

2. [Economic Activity or Measures, Michigan, USA](Michigan_Economic_Issues.ipynb)  
This mini-project intends to explore the following questions from the publically available datasets from the State of Michigan (Year 2009 to 2016):  
    - The safety situation in the State of Michigan, are the crimes increasing or decreasing over the years?
    - How the crime rates are associated to the Unemployment in youth and overall unemployment in the State?
    - Is there any relation between the number of crimes and the average per-capita income of the people of Michigan?
    
3. [Sample-oriented Task-driven Interactive Visualizations](Interactive_Bar_Graph.ipynb)  
This mini-project is based on the following paper:  
Ferreira, N., Fisher, D., & Konig, A. C. (2014, April). "Sample-oriented task-driven visualizations: allowing users to make better, more confident decisions". In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 571-580). ACM.  

    It explores the ideas presented by the authors to implement interactive visualizations that may help the readers to easy grasp the key ideas from the graphs.
